# Example inventory for qrpc deployment (YAML).
# Copy this file into ansible/env/real/inventory.yml and replace the hostnames
# and SSH settings with your own.
# The playbook requires you to pass an explicit FQDN via `-e qrpc_target_host=...`
# so there is no need for environment/group names here.
